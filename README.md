## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior for an e-commerce company to evaluate the effectiveness of discounting strategies, customer segmentation, and revenue growth drivers. Despite high customer engagement, the business experienced flat revenue growth, prompting a deeper investigation into whether promotions were generating incremental value or eroding margins.

Using PostgreSQL, the analysis explores how discount usage, age, location, loyalty status, and purchase intent influence revenue, purchase frequency, and customer value. The project mirrors a real-world stakeholder request, translating raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## Key Business Sub-Questions
-Are discounts driving incremental revenue or simply reducing margins? <br>
-Which customer segments respond positively to discounts?<br>
-Is the business unintentionally cannibalizing revenue from loyal or high-intent customers?<br>
-How do age and location impact revenue growth and customer value?<br>

## Analytical Approach
-Cleaned and transformed raw transaction data using Postgres SQL<br>
-Segmented customers by age, income level, loyalty membership, and discount usage<br>
-Compared discounted vs non-discounted behavior across revenue, frequency, and satisfaction<br>
-Identified cannibalization risk and low-ROI discount patterns<br>
-Quantified revenue contribution and efficiency using rates, percentages, and per-customer metrics<br>

## Tools and Technologies
